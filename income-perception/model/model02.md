### Stock-flow *model02*, with real and financial elements

- We observe both the real and monetary sides of the economy.

  

- We consider loans and deposits, with their interests.

  

- Enterprises have initial endowments.

  

- When agents abstein from consuming, their savings increase liquidity.

  

- Investments are uniquely for replacement, without technical progress.

  
  
- We use specific random sequences for both each agent and each function.

each **agent** has the **functions**:

- **buyConsumptionGoods** 

  $C_{i,t}=c_{i,t} (W+D_{i,t-1}+X^d_{i,t-1}-X^l_{i,t-1})$; using $D_{i,t-1},X^d_{i,t-1},X^l_{i,t-1}$ we introduce lags with (possible) cyclical effect

  being $bu$ the buyer and $se$ the seller (firm), for each fraction $C_{i,t}/k$ 

  ($k$ is the number of buying actions in each cycle with random share [0,`maxConsumptionShareInSubstep`))

  $\Delta M1^f_{se,t}=C_{bu,t}/k$

  $\Delta M1_{bu,t}=-C_{bu,t}/k$

  $\Pi_{i,t}=R_{i,t}-W N^w_{i,t}-X^l_{i,t}+p(v^f_{i,t}-v^i_{i,t})$
  
  reordering, we have:
  
  $\underbrace{\Pi_{i,t}+W N^w_{i,t}+X^l_{i,t}}_{\textrm{direct added value}}=\underbrace{R_{i,t}+p(v^f_{i,t}-v^i_{i,t})}_{\textrm{indirect added value (*)}}$

  $\Delta M1_{i,t}=\delta_{i,t}$

  $\Delta M1^f_{i,t}=-\delta_{i,t}$

  

each **bank** has the **functions**:

- **produce** function (production of bank services in quantity), analogously with the firm one

  

- **payWages**

  paying $W$ to each worker in each time $t$

  $\Delta M1_{i,t}=W$ for  $a_i \in \mathbf{A}^w$

  $\Delta M1^b_{bu,t}=-I_{bu,t}/k$

  

- **distributeDividend**

  $\delta_{i,t}=\rho\Pi_{i,t}$​​

  $\Delta M1_{i,t}=\delta_{i,t}$

  $\Delta M1^b_{i,t}=-\delta_{i,t}$

  

- **makeBalanceSheet**, with:

  being $d_{i}=1$ we have $v^f_{i,t}=v^i_{i,t}=0$

  $R_{i,t}=p s_{i,t}+\sum_{a_i}X^l_{i,t}+\sum_{f_i}X^l_{i,t}$

  $\Pi_{i,t}=R_{i,t}-W N^w_{i,t}-\sum_{a_i}X^d_{i,t}-\sum_{f_i}X^d_{i,t}$

  reordering, we have:

  $\underbrace{\Pi_{i,t}+W N^w_{i,t}+\sum_{a_i}X^d_{i,t}}_{\textrm{direct added value}}=\underbrace{R_{i,t}-\sum_{f_i}X^d_{i,t}}_{\textrm{indirect added value (*)}}$

  (*) the cost of bought-in materials and components is missing by construction in this version of the model, excepted the interests on deposits paid to firms		

  

- Every time we observe a transaction between an agent (or a firm) and its bank, we record the corresponding financial flow on the checking account (or bank account) of the agent (or firm) and on that mantained by the bank with the central bank 

## agent setup

- agent basic creation

  

- creation of entrepreneur list

  

- selecting entrepreneurs and creating their firms or their banks

  

- with a given (heterogeneous) productivity

  

- linking the firm or the bank to its entrepreneur, considering the entrepreneur itself as a worker in its firm or bank

  

- creation of a temporary workforce list of to-be-employed agent, escluding entrepreneurs (already self employed)

  

- applying the unemployement rate to exclude agents

  

- assigning workforce (to-be-employed agents) to firms or banks, with a reinforcement mechanism, gradually giving more attraction/hiring capability to firms or banks growing the most

  

- assigning agents and firms to banks in a random way

  

- endowments provided to the enterprises are proportional to the initial workforce, being extracted from a random-normal distribution with $\mu=\alpha N^w_i$ and $\sigma=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}N^w_i$ (substituting $\alpha$ with $\alpha^f$ for the firms, or with $\alpha^b$ for the banks)
